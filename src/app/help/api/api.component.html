    In the FAANG data portal, FAANG data is classified into three main categories: 1) Samples including animals
    (the type is <a href="/organism">organism</a>) and specimens (the type is <a href="/specimen">specimen</a>),
    2) Experimental data including datasets (the type is <a href="/dataset">dataset</a>) and files (the type is
    <a href="/file">file</a>) and 3) Analyses (the type is <a href="/analysis">analysis</a>).
    Within each type, there are two levels of data: list of records meeting certain criteria (filters in the left panel)
    and record details.

  <h2>How can I access data programmatically?</h2>
  <p>In addition to the data portal, FAANG also provides APIs which allow programmatic access to FAANG data.</p>

  <h4 id="endpoint">Endpoints</h4>
  In the URI template provided below, any field which needs to be assigned with an actual value by the user is
  represented as ":field". The optional fields are wrapped with [ ]. There are two types of endpoints:
  <ul>
    <li>List of records from one type</li>
    <b>http://data.faang.org/api/:type/_search/?_source=_id[&size=:size]</b> where the parameter <i>size</i> defines
    how many records are returned from the server and the default value is 20.
    <li>Record detail</li>
    <b>http://data.faang.org/api/:type/:entityID</b><br>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="example">Examples</h4>
  Get all available animals: <pre><code>curl "http://data.faang.org/api/organism/_search/?_source=_id&size=1000"</code></pre>
  Get information for animal with BioSample accession SAMEA7999918: <pre><code>curl "http://data.faang.org/api/organism/SAMEA7999918"</code></pre>
  Get information for sample with BioSample accession SAMEA4451650: <pre><code>curl "http://data.faang.org/api/specimen/SAMEA4451650"</code></pre>

  <h4 id="response">Parse the response</h4>
  The API is built on Elasticsearch, therefore the returned response is a typical Elasticsearch result. It is important
  to know where to look for the desired information. For the endpoint for list, the useful information can be found
  under <b>hits</b> field. The total number of return records is saved in the <b>hits.total</b> field while the
  information for each individual record is under <b>hits.hits</b> which is an array. If you want to retrieve all
  records from one type, you need to make sure that the value for the parameter <i>size</i> must be no less than the
  value in the <b>hits.total</b> field.
  For the endpoint for detail, the details of the record can be found under <b>_source</b> field

  <h4 id="advanced">Advanced options</h4>
  <p>The endpoints mentioned above only provide the basic functionality to make it possible to retrieve information
    for all records from one type of data. Elasticsearch is a powerful search platform, with many additional options
    available and described in the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search.html"
                                      target="_blank">Elasticsearch version 6.5 documentation</a>.
  </p>
  <h4 class="example">Examples</h4>
  Only return male animal records:
  <pre><code>curl POST "http://data.faang.org/api/organism/_search/" -d '&#123;
  "query": &#123;
            "bool" : &#123;
              "filter" : &#123;
                "term" : &#123;"sex.text" : "male"&#125;
              &#125;
          &#125;
  &#125;
&#125;' </code></pre>
  List all species stores in the data portal with counts:
  <pre><code>curl POST "http://data.faang.org/api/organism/_search/" -d '&#123;
    "aggs" : &#123;
        "organism" : &#123;
            "terms" : &#123; "field" : "organism.text" &#125;
        &#125;
    &#125;
&#125;'
</code></pre>
  <p>
    To use the advanced options, you need to know the data structure which is accessible <a href="https://github.com/FAANG/faang-portal-backend/tree/master/elasticsearch">here</a>. A useful hint for query construction, is that you can replicate the functionality (e.g. filtering, sorting) of the data portal search and filters. To do so, use your internet browsers development tools, for example in Google Chrome, under View menu, click Developer, then Developer tool, a plugin window will pop up. In the window, click "Network" tab, then "Headers" tab, scroll down to "Request Payload", click view source. The JSON can then be used in your own query by supplying after the -d in single quotation marks as shown above.
