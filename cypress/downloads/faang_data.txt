PRJEB27638        | Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA) is a chronic respiratory disease of sheep caused by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV). JSRV infects respiratory epithelial cells and initiates tumor growth. OPA is an important economic and welfare issue for sheep farmers but is also considered to be a valuable animal model for human lung adenocarcinoma. In this study, whole transcriptome profiling was performed on lung samples derived from JSRV-infected and uninfected lambs using RNA-seq. |         | ['ENA']        |            |                       |                     | ['transcription profiling by high throughput sequencing']                                                                                         | Legacy   | true            |
